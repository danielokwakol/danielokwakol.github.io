I've had knowledge of HTML & CSS for some time now, but hadn't taken time to build anything.

There was never a perfect reason for doing so; because of that, I've never gotten better at 
it. So, this site will be a workshop. It is not complete and I don't expect it to be for a little while.

It's helped that [Jekyll][jekyll-docs]{:target="_blank"} was easy to start and has a default theme, [Minima][Minima theme]{:target="_blank"}, which I have taken to 
customising and will later replace with a something built from scratch but still using Jekyll to 
generate the pages.

{% include image.html url="/assets/Img/Minima.png" description="Minima default" %}

Besides work on web development (learning JavaScript), I plan to turn this into a blog for ideas I usually leave 
in my mind or post on social media, occassionally. It will also serve as a store for links to interesting things 
I pick up online.
